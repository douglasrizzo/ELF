The repository originally contained an assortment of Python and shell scripts teaching how to interact with ELF through the command line. They were all moved to this directory.

With time, I hope to document their usage, by gathering examples from available tutorials and docs, and maybe create a better way to interface with ELF without the need of so much clutter.

Be mindful to call the scripts from the top-level project directory, i.e. ELF, not from this directory, as there are relative links inside all of them
